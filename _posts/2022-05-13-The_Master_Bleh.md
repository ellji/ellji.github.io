*Kai can stay though, she's great.*

Episodes 4-6: Meh. Decent Covenant battle though. Jack-yap stole the show.

Episode 7: We knew this was coming, and it's as bad as we thought it would be. At least we get an explosion.

Episode 8:

1. *What the fuck*.
2. That's pretty on-brand for Halsey, but she's normally more subtle about it.
3. Cortana has significantly redeemed herself over the last few episodes, in no small part due to Jen Taylor carrying the whole shebang on her back.
4. *What the fuck*.

ps: *Reach City, Planet Reach?* What the hell happened to *New Alexandria*?
