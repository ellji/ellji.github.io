*War Crimes are bad.*

The first episode of the very long awaited Halo(tm) show is out, and I have some thoughts, as delivered while watching the show. 

***Spoilers Ahead.***

- Sound and special FX are fairly accurate to the games, which is nice.
- Why are guns that do nothing to Covenant become automagically more powerful once a Spartan holds them?
- What the fuck is up with the Elite's armour, it's worse than the Halo 5 designs.
- Never trust Bern Gorman.
- Elites are dumb as fuck; "Hey there’s these four Spartans killing everything I'm going to ignore them and try to kill a girl under a truck instead".
- That’s not Halsey's character in the slightest.
- High Charity looks like a goddamn mushroom.
- This is also not Miranda Keyes.
- Oh god whenever John talks or walks my subwoofer goes nuts.
- This is NOT FUCKING JACOB KEYES EITHER.
- Okay John has a joke that’s actually kind of funny.
- Why did they write the UNSC as complete bastards?
- Even Parangosky isn’t really right.
- Hey a suitup sequence, nice.
- Why do they keep calling a Pelican a Condor? (*looks it up*, oh, a Condor is a long range Pelican.)
<br><br>
- Oh boy that was awful , I want to see more.
<br><br><br><br>
- Also Mass Effect reference lol.
