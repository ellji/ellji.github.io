Hi, my name is Chris and I'm addicted to Reddit.

*Hi Chris.*

It should come as no surprise to a lot of people that I can be incredibly short tempered, highly defensive, and often maddingly illogical. And nothing, (and I mean nothing, well apart from maybe my brother) can bring that side out from me like Reddit.

Reddit is the perfect example of something that's entirely possible to lovehate. Like children, it occasionally escalates to loverage. This is caused by primarily two factors:

1. Pretty much anyone can post pretty much anything on it, and
2. "Pretty much anyone" includes people that are mostly like myself.
