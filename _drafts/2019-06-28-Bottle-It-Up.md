*Dramatic climaxes always need Sakura Petals.*

I think I'm way too easy to emotionally manipulate sometimes.

Give me a theatrical scene with some cheesy melodramatic dialogue and a soundtrack to match and my brain short-circuits.

It happened with *Gurren Lagaan* and *Kill La Kill*, it happened with *Your Name* and *Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai*, and now it's happened with *Your Lie In April*.

*Your Lie In April*, or *Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso*
