title: Indies: Stop making fangames, it's bad for the industry, and it's bad for you.

This is a formalised version of the twitter thread I posted here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">indies, again, for the record: you shouldn&#39;t be putting your time and effort into other people&#39;s IP (when you don&#39;t have the rights)</p>&mdash; Chris Hayward (@ellji) <a href="https://twitter.com/ellji/status/800569826993262592">November 21, 2016</a></blockquote>

This was basically kicked off by the removal of the fangame projects AM2R (Metroid 2 remake) and Pokemon: Uranium from the [Game Awards 2016](http://thegameawards.com/nominees/).

Good.

Not only is it vaguely insulting to actual original work to go up against a remake of (insanely) popular intellectual properties (which by the way, neither projects have any legal right to), but I think it's actively harmful to the small independent game development community to have such efforts be recognised in such a way.
