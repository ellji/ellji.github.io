title: Indies: Stop making fangames, it's bad for the industry, and it's bad for you.

This is a formalised version of the twitter thread I posted here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">indies, again, for the record: you shouldn&#39;t be putting your time and effort into other people&#39;s IP (when you don&#39;t have the rights)</p>&mdash; Chris Hayward (@ellji) <a href="https://twitter.com/ellji/status/800569826993262592">November 21, 2016</a></blockquote>

This was basically kicked off by the removal of the fangame projects AM2R (Metroid 2 remake) and Pokemon: Uranium from the [Game Awards 2016](http://thegameawards.com/nominees/).

**_Good._**

Not only is it vaguely insulting to actual original work to go up against a remake of (insanely) popular intellectual properties (which by the way, neither projects have any legal right to), but I think it's actively harmful to the small independent game development community to have such efforts be recognised in such a way. Don't get me wrong, I think mods that are sanctioned by the developer are fine - in those cases you a) have legal permission and b) it's no different to using a game engine. Even mods that recreate previous content like Brutal Doom 64 and Black Mesa are fine. In either case they have the explicit permission of the IP holder to release those works, and they are both transformative, updating older game mechanics and refining what came before.

I don't disagree that both AM2R and Uranium do the latter, both are taking the existing games and adding refinements and tweaks to the mechanics of the franchise. They both however violate the former; Nintendo has not and are unlikely to ever give permission to the developers to make and release these games.

To which I say to the developers; **Are you insane?** Why would you ever put months if not years of effort into developing a work using an IP you have no right to? Why would you put that much effort into something a well-paid laywer in a large company can obliterate with a single A4 page of text? Why would you devote so much time and effort into something you cannot ever gain compensation for?

It's one thing to love a franchise.
